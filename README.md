# memcached-tool-ng

An enhanced version of memcached's memcached-tool script

# What does it do ?

It shows memcached metrics per slab and a few global metrics.

# That's what memcached-tool does

Yes... but memcached-tool-ng shows also the memory efficiency per slab (allocated pages vs items size) and the global node efficiency.

# How can I use it ?

Exactly the same way as memcached-tool:

	./memcached-tool-ng ip_address_of_memcached
